=== Transcript

The application logic of Red Hat Fuse Online is packaged into several Kubernetes Pods.
The Pods are syndesis-oauthproxy, syndesis-ui, syndesis-server, syndesis-meta, syndesis-prometheus and syndesis-db.
Respectively, they serve as the Single-Sign On authorization service, the web console, the application runtime, metadata management service, logging analysis service and the embedded PostgresDB database.
Upon login, the Single-Sign On authorization service grants the necessary access privileges to the rest of the pods. Every interaction with the tool, be it design or monitoring of integrations and connections, by the Citizen Developer, is via the web console.
Logging as well as metadata storage and retrieval takes place when integrations are active. Finally, the database provides the necessary management and persistence capabilites for operational data.
