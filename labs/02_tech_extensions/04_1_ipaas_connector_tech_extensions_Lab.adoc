== Connector Technical Extensions Lab - Customize and implement an existing technical extension as a connector

This course includes at least one lab per module. Each lab is hands-on and typically takes about an hour to complete. Executing the course labs prepares you to correctly answer many of the final assessment questions.

.Goals
* Customize an existing technical extension
* Implement technical extension as a connector
* Using Fuse Ignite, create an integration using this connector extension
* Test the integration

.Pre-requisites
*  Completion of *Integration Lab - Data Synchronization on the Cloud: Microservice to Flat File scenario*

Your organization intends to launch a demand generation campaign for a new product.
A promotional flyer has to be sent over social media channels as a tweet.
You have been asked to design an integration solution which this campaign will depend on.

In order to meet your organization's requirements for a demand generation campaign, you plan to utilize 2 connectors: a AWS S3 connector and a Twitter connector, as well as a pre-packaged technical extension `log`, which writes a message to the log stream. You will create a custom step using this pre-packaged technical extension and then utilize the custom step in a new integration, using Red Hat Fuse Ignite.

=== Logon to Red Hat Fuse Ignite

You will proceed to utilize the Fuse Ignite environment.

. Check your email inbox for the same email you received earlier, containing a link to Red Hat Fuse Ignite.
+
CAUTION: Red Hat Fuse Ignite is supported for the following web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge
+
. Click this link to display the Red Hat Fuse Ignite login page.

. Log in using your OPENTLC account. The Fuse Ignite console page appears.

=== Compile the technical extension

You will compile a pre-developed technical extension as part of the integration.

//include an image of a Application Developer handing over a technical extension to a Citizen Developer

An application developer can build a technical extension which serves as the implementation for a custom step. The application developer then transfers the technical extension, as a .jar archive, over to the citizen developer, who proceeds to upload the technical extension into the Fuse Ignite project environment. The citizen developer then creates a custom step using this technical extension, and reuses it in multiple integrations.

[NOTE]
Learn how a technical extension is developed with the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/tooling_user_guide/igniteextension/[JBoss Fuse Tooling Guide]. You will appreciate from this guide that certain conventions regarding a custom developed technical extensionâ€™s JSON file contents must be observed.

The community project for Fuse Ignite is called `Syndesis`. Extension archetypes have to be compiled prior to the compilation and use of technical extensions within a Fuse Ignite integration.

. Using a command-line terminal window, clone a repository containing the code base for `Syndesis` into a working directory which is referred to here as `$lab_dir`
+
----
$ cd $lab_dir
$ git clone https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/syndesis
----
+
. In the terminal window, navigate to the subdirectory called `/syndesis/tools/bin` and execute the command to compile the `Syndesis` code:
+
----
$ cd $lab_dir/syndesis/tools/bin
$ ./syndesis build
----
+
. A successful compilation will result in the following messages:

=== Import the technical extension

You will import the compiled technical extension into Fuse Ignite, which will form a part of the integration that you will develop.

. Click on the *Customizations* tab on the left-hand pane of the Red Hat Fuse Ignite console.
. Select the *Extensions* tab located on the top of the console.
. Click the *Import Extension* button.
. Click *Browse* and select the JAR file containing the `syndesis-extension-loop` technical extension.
+
[TIP]
Should import of an archive file containing an extension fail, it is likely that the extension contains invalid code that causes the validation (by the rules contained in the *Meta* OpenShift pod ) to fail. Analyze and debug the code in the JBoss Developer Studio tooling before attempting the import process again.
+
image::images/import-extension.png[]
+
. Click *Import Extension*.
+
image::images/extension-details.png[]
+
[NOTE]
On the Fuse Ignite console, the name, ID, type, description and time of last update of the technical extension are listed. In addition, the supported steps (the objective of the extension) and the integrations using this extension are indicated in the *Extension Details* page.
+
. Click the *Update* button.
. In the left-hand pane, click *Integrations*.
. Note the details of the *Loop* technical extension displayed, which includes the function of the step as well as the name of the extension.

The technical extension, that you have just imported, is now available for use with any integration.


=== Adding a custom step

You will add the newly imported technical extension as a custom step to an integration.

. In the left-hand pane of Fuse Ignite console, click *Integrations*.
. Select the _Microservice to File_ integration. If you have not completed the pre-requisite lab, this will be the time to do so.
. Click on the *Edit Integration* button on the top right hand corner of the console.
. On the *Integration Editor* page, move your mouse cursor over the Data Mapper custom step, between the *Start Connection* and the *Finish Connection*.
. Click on the icon of the trash bin. The custom step is deleted.
. Click the *Add a Step* button located at the centre of the Fuse Ignite console. Alternatively, you can also move your mouse cursor of the `+` sign located between both connections and select *Add a step*.
+
image::images/add-a-step.png[]
+
. On the *Choose a Step* page, select the custom step *Loop*. This step is now available as you have imported the technical extension in the earlier lab section.
+
image::images/choose-a-step.png[]
+
. Assign a positive value for the *Cycles* field and click *Next*.
+
image::images/configure-loop.png[]
+
. Click *Publish*.

Once the integration is active (a green checkbox appears and the state of the integration becomes *Published*), testing of the integration can proceed.


=== Test the integration

You will test the integration and validate the results.

. Logon to your remote hosting service and delete the previous file containing the product catalog data.
. Logoff from the remote hosting service.
. Wait for a few minutes.
. Logon back to your remote hosting service. This time validate that the file containing the product catalog data is present.


=== Housekeeping

You will clean up the integration. as a housekeeping best practice.

. In the left-hand pane, click *Integrations*.
. Locate the entry for the _Microservice to File_ integration.
. Click the icon displaying three black dots in a vertical sequence, located right of the green check box. A drop down list appears.
. Select *Unpublish* from the drop down list, followed by selecting *OK* in the pop-up window. This will deactivate the integration.
* If you are utilizing the Fuse Ignite Technical Preview, some other integration can now be published and tested.
+
[NOTE]
The next few steps are optional. Use them only when you are certain that the integration will never be required again.
+
. Locate the entry for the _Microservice to File_ integration.
. Click the icon displaying three black dots in a vertical sequence, located right of the green check box. A drop down list appears.
. Click *Delete Integration*, followed by clicking *OK*, at the bottom of the summary pane.

You have successfully implemented and tested a connector extension as a custom step in an integration.
