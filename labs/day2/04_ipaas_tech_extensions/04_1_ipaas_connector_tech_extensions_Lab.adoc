= Connector Technical Extensions Lab - Customize and implement an existing technical extension as a connector

This course includes at least one lab per module. Each lab is hands-on and typically takes about an hour to complete. Executing the course labs prepares you to correctly answer many of the final assessment questions.

.Goals
* Customize an existing technical extension
* Implement technical extension as a connector
* Using Fuse Ignite, create an integration using this connector extension
* Test the integration

.Pre-requisites
* Completion of *Integration Lab - Data Synchronization on the Cloud: Microservice to Flat File scenario* in Module 2
* Apache Maven must be installed on your local PC
** Download link:https://maven.apache.org/download.html[Apache Maven].
** Complete the installation by following this https://maven.apache.org/install.html[guide].

This lab involves an enhancement to an existing integration: the _Microservice to File_ integration from Module 2.
The enhancement involves adding a technical extension that adds loop cycles to the synchronization process.

image::images/arch-microservice-loop-file.png[]

An application developer can build a technical extension which serves as the implementation for a custom step. The application developer then transfers the technical extension, as a .jar archive, over to the citizen developer, who proceeds to upload the technical extension into the Fuse Ignite project environment. The citizen developer then creates a custom step using this technical extension, and reuses it in multiple integrations.

[NOTE]
Learn how a technical extension is developed with the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/tooling_user_guide/igniteextension/[JBoss Fuse Tooling Guide]. You will appreciate from this guide that certain conventions regarding a custom developed technical extensionâ€™s JSON file contents must be observed.

:numbered:


== Logon to Red Hat Fuse Ignite

You will proceed to utilize the Fuse Ignite environment.

. Check your email inbox for the same email you received earlier, containing a link to Red Hat Fuse Ignite.
+
CAUTION: Red Hat Fuse Ignite is supported for the following web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge
+
. Click this link to display the Red Hat Fuse Ignite login page.

. Log in using your OPENTLC account. The Fuse Ignite console page appears.


== Import Microservice to Flat File Integration

You will setup the _Microservice to Flat File_ integration again.

. Reimport the _Microservice to Flat File_ integration which was backed up in an earlier lab.
. Ensure that _Microservice to Flat File_ integration is published and active.


== [OPTIONAL] Compile Syndesis code

In order to proceed with compilation of a technical extension, you need the compiled code base of the community project `Syndesis`.

The community project for Fuse Ignite is called `Syndesis`. Extension archetype dependencies of the `io.syndesis.extension.api` package have to be compiled prior to the compilation and use of technical extensions within a Fuse Ignite integration.

Here is an example of a few import statements for these dependencies in a Connector Extension *LoopAction*, followed by the use of `Step` which has a dependency on  `io.syndesis.extension.api.Step`:

----
import io.syndesis.extension.api.Step;
import io.syndesis.extension.api.annotations.Action;
import io.syndesis.extension.api.annotations.ConfigurationProperty;

@Action(id = "loop", name = "Loop", description = "Add a loop to your exchange", tags = { "loop", "extension"})
public class LoopAction implements Step {

----

As an optional exercise, in this section you will compile the code base for the community project `Syndesis`. If you wish, you may skip this section, as the code base is provided for you to use in the next lab section.

. link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpe-mw-training/fuse-ipaas-labs/master/04_technical_extensions/settings.xml[Download] the Apache Maven `settings.xml` file while contains references to the Apache Maven repositories.
. Copy the `settings.xml` file into your ``~/.m2` directory, where at least one local Maven repository will reside.
. Open `~/.m2/settings.xml` for edit, using your favorite editor.
. Validate that the contents within the *<repositories>* *</repositories>* tags resemble:

. Close the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file without making or saving any changes.
. Using a command-line terminal window, link:https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis/releases/tag/syndesis-1.3.4.fuse-000002[download] the code base for `Syndesis` in zip format, into a working directory which is referred to here as `$lab_dir`
. Expand the zip archive.
. In the terminal window, navigate to the subdirectory called `/syndesis/tools/bin` and execute the command to compile the `Syndesis` code:
+
----
$ cd $lab_dir/syndesis/tools/bin
$ ./syndesis build -f
----
+
. A successful compilation will result in the following messages:

== Setup of Maven Repository for Syndesis

You will complete this section, if you previously have not compiled the code for `Syndesis`.

. If you have not done so, link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpe-mw-training/fuse-ipaas-labs/master/04_technical_extensions/settings.xml[download] the Apache Maven `settings.xml` file while contains references to the Apache Maven repositories.
. link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_t1RTZMwddl7AbvMbB-fX6Su9HHLe3ns[Download] an Apache Maven Repository (in zipped archive format) that has previously compiled Maven archetypes that will be used in the compilation of `Syndesis`.
. Copy or move the zip archive to the working directory `$lab_dir`, then unzip the contents.
. Open `~/.m2/settings.xml` for edit, using your favorite editor.
. Replace references to the directory `/tmp` tags with `/$lab_dir/maven-syndesis-extension-1.0.0.fuse-000018`, where `$lab_dir` is the path of your working directory.
. Save the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file.


== [OPTIONAL] Compile a technical extension

You will compile a technical extension as part of the integration. Note that this lab is optional, as a pre-compiled technical extension is provided for your use in subsequent lab sections.

. Using a new web browser, download the latest technical extensions link:https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-extensions/releases[*release*] for Fuse Ignite.
. Extract the archive, containing the technical extensions, into the working directory `$lab_dir`.
. Using a command-line terminal window, navigate to the subdirectory containing the code for the technical extension `syndesis-extension-loop`.
. Within this subdirectory `syndesis-extension-loop`, compile the technical extension using the command:
+
----
$ mvn -N install

. Locate the *syndesis-extension-loop-1.0.0.fuse-000018.jar* file in the `target` subdirectory of the directory named `syndesis-extension-loop`. This is the JAR archive file containing the `syndesis-extension-loop` technical extension.
+
[TIP]
You can either move or copy this JAR archive file to a directory with a shorter naming convention (like `/tmp`). That will help speed up import of the technical extension at the next lab section.


== Import the technical extension

You will import the compiled technical extension into Fuse Ignite, which will form a part of the integration that you will enhance.

. If you have not completed the previous section, locate the pre-compiled technical extension by navigating to the `$lab_dir/maven-syndesis-extension-1.0.0.fuse-000018/io/syndesis/extensions/syndesis-extension-loop/1.0.0.fuse-000018` directory. The JAR archive *syndesis-extension-loop-1.0.0.fuse-000018.jar* contains the `syndesis-extension-loop` technical extension.
. Click on the *Customizations* tab on the left-hand pane of the Red Hat Fuse Ignite console.
. Select the *Extensions* tab located on the top of the console.
. Click the *Import Extension* button.
+
image::images/import-extensions.png[]
+
. Click *Browse* and select the JAR archive file containing the `syndesis-extension-loop` technical extension.
+
[TIP]
Should import of an archive file containing a technical extension fail, it is likely that the extension contains invalid code that causes the validation (by the rules contained in the *Meta* OpenShift pod ) to fail. Analyze and debug the code using link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/tooling_user_guide/igniteextension/[JBoss Developer Studio] before attempting the import process again.
+
image::images/import-extension.png[]
+
. Click *Import Extension*.
+
image::images/extension-details.png[]
+
[NOTE]
On the Fuse Ignite console, the name, ID, type, description and time of last update of the technical extension are listed. In addition, the supported steps (the objective of the extension) and the integrations using this extension are indicated in the *Extension Details* page.
+
. Click the *Update* button.
. In the left-hand pane, click *Customizations -> Extensions*.
. Note the details of the *Loop* technical extension displayed, which includes the function of the step as well as the name of the extension.

The technical extension, that you have just imported, is now available for use with any integration.


== Test the integration without a custom step

You will test the integration and validate the results.

. Logon to your remote hosting service and delete the previous file containing the product catalog data.
. Logoff from the remote hosting service.
. Wait for a few seconds.
. Logon back to your remote hosting service. This time validate that the file containing the product catalog data is present.
. Repeat this test as many times as you can. With each test, record the time it took for the file to re-appear on the remote hosting service.


== Adding a custom step

You will add the newly imported technical extension as a custom step to an integration.

. In the left-hand pane of Fuse Ignite console, click *Integrations*.
. Select the _Microservice to File_ integration. If you have not completed the lab in Module 2, this will be the time to do so.
. Click on the *Edit Integration* button on the top right hand corner of the console.
. On the *Integration Editor* page, move your mouse cursor over the Data Mapper custom step, between the *Start Connection* and the *Finish Connection*.
. Click on the icon of the trash bin. The custom step is deleted.
. Click the *Add a Step* button located at the centre of the Fuse Ignite console. Alternatively, you can also move your mouse cursor of the `+` sign located between both connections and select *Add a step*.
+
image::images/add-a-step.png[]
+
. On the *Choose a Step* page, select the custom step *Loop*. This step is now available as you have imported the technical extension in the earlier lab section.
+
image::images/choose-a-step.png[]
+
. Assign a positive value for the *Cycles* field and click *Next*.
+
image::images/configure-loop.png[]
+
. Click *Publish*.

Once the integration is active (a green checkbox appears and the state of the integration becomes *Published*), testing of the integration can proceed.


== Test and monitor the integration with the new custom step

You will test the integration and validate the results.

. Access the Hawtio Console embedded in the integration pod, which you have previously done so as part of *Integration Lab - Data Synchronization on the Cloud: Microservice to Flat File scenario* in Module 2.
. Through the use of the Hawtio Console, monitor the various statistics of this edition of the integration.
. Compare and analyse both sets of statistical results - the first set before the custom step was added, and the latest set with the custom step added.
. Logon to your remote hosting service and delete the previous file containing the product catalog data.
. Logoff from the remote hosting service.
. Wait for a minute or more.
. Logon back to your remote hosting service. This time validate that the file containing the product catalog data is present.
. Repeat this test as many times as you can. With each test, record the time it took for the file to re-appear on the remote hosting service.

*QUESTION:* What are observations can be made regarding the performance results of both editions of the _Microservice to File_ integration - one without the custom step and one with the custom step?


== [OPTIONAL] Replace loop extension with other extensions

You will experiment with the use of other connector extensions.

. Replace the existing *Loop* connector extension with other link:https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-extensions[extensions] from the upstream community project
. Test the integration upon implementing each extension and observe the various results.

*QUESTION 1:* Does the behavior of the integration change, and can you compile a list of the behavioral changes - referencing each extension used?

*QUESTION 2:* Which technical extension augments the test results in time difference between the editions of the _Microservice to File_ integration - one without a custom step, and one with a custom step ?


== Housekeeping

You will clean up the integration. as a housekeeping best practice.

. In the left-hand pane, click *Integrations*.
. Locate the entry for the _Microservice to File_ integration.
. Click the icon displaying three black dots in a vertical sequence, located right of the green check box. A drop down list appears.
. Select *Unpublish* from the drop down list, followed by selecting *OK* in the pop-up window. This will deactivate the integration.
* If you are utilizing the Fuse Ignite Technical Preview, some other integration can now be published and tested.
+
[NOTE]
The next few steps are optional. Use them only when you are certain that the integration will never be required again.
+
. Locate the entry for the _Microservice to File_ integration.
. Click the icon displaying three black dots in a vertical sequence, located right of the green check box. A drop down list appears.
. Click *Delete Integration*, followed by clicking *OK*, at the bottom of the summary pane.

You have successfully implemented and tested a connector extension as a custom step in an integration.
