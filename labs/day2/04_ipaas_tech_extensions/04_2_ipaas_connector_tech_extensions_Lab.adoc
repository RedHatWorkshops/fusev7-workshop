== Connector Technical Extensions Lab - utilize a technical extension in a marketing campaign use case

This course includes at least one lab per module. Each lab is hands-on and typically takes about an hour to complete. Executing the course labs prepares you to correctly answer many of the final assessment questions.

.Goals
* Create an integration using AWS S3 and Twitter connectors
* Create a custom step in Red Hat Fuse Ignite using a `syndesis-extension-log-body` technical extension
* Introduce the custom step into the integration

.Requirements
* Completion of Lab 1 of Module 4 - *Connector Technical Extensions Lab - Customize and implement an existing technical extension as a connector*
* Completion of Lab 2 of Module 2 - *Twitter to Salesforce Lab*
* Registered for a Twitter account
* Registered for a AWS account
* JDK 1.8 installed

`Coolstore` marketing department intends to launch a demand generation campaign for a new product.
A promotional flyer has to be sent over social media channels as a tweet.
You have been asked to design an integration solution which this campaign will depend on.

In order to meet your organization's requirements for a demand generation campaign, your Fuse Ignite integration design will utilize 2 connectors: a AWS S3 connector and a Twitter connector, as well as a pre-packaged technical extension `log`, which writes a message to the log stream. You will create a custom step using this pre-packaged technical extension and then utilize the custom step in a new integration, using Red Hat Fuse Ignite.

=== Logon to Red Hat Fuse Ignite

You will proceed to utilize the Fuse Ignite environment.

. Check your email inbox for the same email you received earlier, containing a link to Red Hat Fuse Ignite.
+
CAUTION: Red Hat Fuse Ignite is supported for the following web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge
+
. Click this link to display the Red Hat Fuse Ignite login page.

. Log in using your OPENTLC account. The Fuse Ignite console page appears.


=== Compile a technical extension

You will implement a custom step in a Fuse Ignite integration, through the use of a logging mechanism, developed as a Fuse Ignite technical extension.
`Coolstore` marketing department will like every notification to be recorded every time the marketing flyer is delivered by Twitter.

You will now compile the code for a pre-developed technical extension, `syndesis-extension-log-body` that will perform recording of marketing notifications.

. Using a command-line terminal window, navigate to the subdirectory `syndesis-extension-log-body` located in the directory containing technical extensions.
. Within the subdirectory `syndesis-extension-loop`, compile the technical extension, using the command:
+
----
$ mvn -N install
----
+
. A successful compilation of the technical extension results in the following message:

. Click *Save*. followed by clicking *OK*.

You have completed the setup of Fuse Ignite as a Twitter client application.

=== Create Salesforce Connection

Before an integration can be created, a connection has to be created for each cloud service endpoint that will be integrated. These cloud services have to support the link:https://oauth.net/2[OAuth protocol].

. On the Fuse Ignite console, click the *Connections* tab.

=== Create Twitter Connection

. On the Fuse Ignite console, click the *Connections* tab.

=== Create Integration between Salesforce and Twitter

The integration starts by accessing the Salesforce application from which data is retrieved from.

. Select the Salesforce connection. This is the *start* connection point of the integration you are creating.
. Select the *action* that the *start* connection has to perform.
. As an option (and this varies among connections), provide configuration information to the *start* connection. For instance, indicate if the action involves either a Salesforce lead or a Salesforce opportunity.
. Select the Twitter connection. This is the *finish* connection which accesses the application that consumes the data retrieved by the *start* connection, thereby completing the integration.
. Select the *action* that the *finish* connection is required to perform. Similarly to the earlier *action* selected, this *action* can involve data update.
. As an option, provide configuration information to the *finish* connection.
. Click *Publish* to begin testing the integration.
+
NOTE: As the business use case evolves, additional connections to other applications can be introduced as part of the integration. These connections can exist anywhere between the *start* connection and the *finish* connection.
+
. OPTIONAL: Add new connections into the integration.
. OPTIONAL: Add several steps in order to manipulate the data used in the integration. _Data filtering and _data mapping_ are recommended steps to introduce.
