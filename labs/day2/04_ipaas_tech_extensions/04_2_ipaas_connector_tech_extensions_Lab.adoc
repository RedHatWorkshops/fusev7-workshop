= Connector Technical Extensions Lab - a digital image file replication solution for a marketing campaign

This course includes at least one lab per module. Each lab is hands-on and typically takes about an hour to complete. Executing the course labs prepares you to correctly answer many of the final assessment questions.

.Goals
* Create an integration using both AWS S3 and FTP connectors
* Create a custom step in Red Hat Fuse Ignite using a `syndesis-extension-log-body` technical extension
* Introduce the custom step into the integration

.Requirements
* Completion of Lab 2 of Module 1 - *Integration Lab - Product Data Synchronization: Microservice to Flat File scenario*
* Completion of Lab 1 of Module 4 - *Connector Technical Extensions Lab - Customize and implement an existing technical extension as a connector*
* Registered for a AWS account
* JDK 1.8 installed

`Coolstore` marketing department intends to launch a demand generation campaign regarding new promotions. Therefore, they have signed a contract with an advertising services vendor, responsible for broadcast advertising of `Coolstore` latest promotions.
`Coolstore` marketing department will design a promotional flyer which will be "handed over" to the advertising services vendor for  multi-channel broadcast use (eg: social media, print advertising and (e)mailers.)

You have been tasked to design the file replication solution, responsible for the transfer of the digital image of a promotional flyer, which this campaign will depend on.

In order to meet the marketing department's requirements for a demand generation campaign, your Fuse Ignite integration design will utilize 2 connectors: a AWS S3 connector and a FTP connector, as well as a pre-packaged technical extension `log`, which writes a message to the log stream. You will create a custom step using this pre-packaged technical extension and then utilize the custom step in a new integration, using Red Hat Fuse Ignite.

The marketing flyer resides on an AWS S3 bucket which is replicated, using a Fuse Ignite integration, to a staging server where the flyer will be retrieved for multiple broadcast use.
You will also implement a custom step in the Fuse Ignite integration, through the use of a Fuse Ignite technical extension.
The purpose of this custom step will be log a notification regarding the availability of the promotional flyer.
`Coolstore` marketing department will like every notification to be recorded and sent to the advertising services vendor, every time the marketing flyer is successfully replicated and hosted on the staging server infrastructure of the vendor.

. Locate the *syndesis-extension-log-body-1.0.0.fuse-000018.jar* file in the `target` subdirectory of the directory named `syndesis-extension-log-body`. This is the JAR archive file containing the `syndesis-extension-log-body` technical extension.
+
[TIP]
You can either move or copy this JAR archive file to a directory with a shorter naming convention (like `/tmp`). That will help speed up import of the technical extension at the next lab section.


== Import the technical extension

You will now import into Fuse Ignite, a pre-developed technical extension, `syndesis-extension-log-body` that will perform this recording of marketing notifications.
At the completion of the previous lab, the code base for the community project `Syndesis` resides in the working directory `$lab_dir`.

. If you have not completed the previous section on compilation of the technical extension, locate the pre-compiled technical extension by navigating to the `$lab_dir/maven-syndesis-extension-1.0.0.fuse-000018/io/syndesis/extensions/syndesis-extension-log-body/1.0.0.fuse-000018` directory.
+
[NOTE]
The JAR archive *syndesis-extension-log-body-1.0.0.fuse-000018.jar* contains the `syndesis-extension-log-body` technical extension.
+
. Using a command-line terminal window, navigate to the subdirectory `syndesis-extension-log-body` located in the directory containing extensions.
. Select the *Customizations* tab on the left-hand pane of Red Hat Fuse Ignite Console.
. Select the *Extensions* tab.
+
image::images/import-extensions.png[]

image::images/configuring-poll-aws-s3.png[]
+
. On the *Poll an Amazon S3 Bucket* screen, examine the configurable fields.
+
[NOTE]
_Delay_ paramater determines the delay interval between polls of the S3 bucket. _Maximum Objects to Retrieve_ determines the maximum number of files in the S3 bucket to be polled and fetched. _Prefix_ is the criteria used by the filename filter, determining which file to fetch.
+
. Click *Done* to complete the setup of the *Start* connection.
. Select on the left-hand panel, the *Finish Connection*.
. Click on the *FTP* connection.
. Specify the value of the *File name expression* field, as `coolstore-flyer.png`.
. Specify the value of the *FTP Directory* field, as `./htdocs`.
. Click *Next* and then *Done* to complete the setup of the *Finish* connection.
. Move your pointer cursor over the *+* sign, which is wedged between the *Start* connection and the *Finish* connection.
. Select *Add a step* located on the callout, next to the *+* sign.
. Select from the drop down box, the `syndesis-extension-log-body` technical extension that you should just created.
. Provide the value *Flyer is ready on staging server* in the message field for the custom step.
. Click *Done*. The custom step has been added to the integration.
. Name the integration _AWS S3 to FTP_.
. Click *Publish*. The integration will be deployed.

*QUESTION:* What changes have to be made, to either the FTP connection or its setup as part of the integration, if now there are multiple promotional flyers, of a wide variety of file formats, to be staged on the vendor's server? Are there also necessary changes that have to made to the AWS S3 connection and its setup during integration design?


== Test the integration

You will test the integration by initiating a demand generation campaign.

. On the left-hand panel of the Fuse Ignite console, click *Integrations*.
. Once the state of the _AWS S3 to FTP_ integration changes to *Published*, proceed to test it.
. Upload to your AWS S3 bucket, the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpe-mw-training/fuse-ipaas-labs/master/04_technical_extensions/coolstore-flyer.png[digital image] that is the promotional flyer.
. Check the log of the OpenShift Pod _AWS S3 to FTP_ for log entries containing the string *Flyer is ready on staging server*.
. Logon to your remote hosting account and validate that the digital image (aka. promotional flyer) appears in the `htdocs` directory.

*QUESTION:* Imagine that access to OpenShift pod logs by both members of the `Coolstore` marketing department and their advertising services vendor is no longer a viable option - due to enhanced corporate security restrictions. What alternative means of both logging and log retrieval can you incorporate in your solution design to address this change in business expectations?
