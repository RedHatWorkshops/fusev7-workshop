You will customize the Spring-based application `Damage Reporter` to address a new business requirement from `Coolstore` Management.

[NOTE]
Learn how a technical extension is developed with the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/tooling_user_guide/igniteextension/[JBoss Fuse Tooling Guide]. You will appreciate from this guide that certain conventions regarding a custom developed technical extension’s JSON file contents must be observed.

[TIP]
For technical extensions that you develope based on an Apache Camel route, and not a bean, the entry point of the extension must correspond to a Camel endpoint on that route. In addition, you have to specify both the input data shape and the output data shape, for a technical extension that transforms data types.

. Walkthrough the code of the `damage-reporter` project located in your JBDS workspace.
+
image::images/damage-reporter-jbds.png[]
+
* *QUESTION:* Can you map the interaction flows between the six Java classes, either using a whiteboard or your favorite UML modeling tool?
* Discuss and compare your findings with your instructor, your classmate or your colleague. If there are differences, try to arrive on a consensus.
. Make necessary code changes to include the following new contacts:
+
[.noredheader,cols="5,5,5",caption=""]
