== Step Technical Extensions Lab

NOTE: This lab takes about an hour to complete. It covers topics you need to know to correctly complete the final assessment.

.Goals
* Create an integration using a custom-developed Spring CDI application as a step extension
* Amend the code in the Spring CDI application to alter the step extension behavior
* Test the integration

.Requirements
* Completion of _AMQ to RESTful Service Connector Lab_
* Completion of _Connector Technical Extensions for File Replication Lab_
* JDK 1.8 installed

.Overview
A consumer goods company, Coolstore, intends to provide a damage reporting service for products sold and shipped from vendor locations. Coolstore management plans to use Fuse Ignite, shapeless connectors, and technical extensions to implement this damaged-product reporting service.

The diagram below documents the sequence of events that allows the damage reporting service on Fuse Ignite to analyze and report the status of product shipments.

. Accept the terms and conditions and click *Finish*.
* This starts the installation of the Fuse Ignite technical extension plug-in.
. After the plug-in is installed, agree to allow Developer Studio to restart.


== Import Damage Reporter Application

In this section, you import the damage reporter application into Developer Studio for analysis and eventual compilation of the code.

. Download the repository containing the lab assets to the `<$lab_dir>` working directory using `git`:
+
----
$ cd <$lab_dir>
$ git clone https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/fuse-ipaas-labs
----

. From the Developer Studio menu, select *File -> Import -> Existing Maven Projects*.
. Navigate to the directory containing the `pom.xml` file for the `damage-reporter` project:
+
----
/<$lab_dir>/fuse_ipaas_labs/04_technical_extensions/damage_reporter
----
. After the project finishes importing, look for the `damage-reporter` project in the *Project Explorer* view in Developer Studio.
+
[NOTE]
The `damage-reporter` project is a Java application that uses an Apache Camel route. The project also implements a Spring-managed component called `reportService`, which generates a list of damaged items that are eventually included, together with the vendor contact list, in the damaged-product report.

. In the *Project Explorer* view, navigate through the `damage-reporter` project source code by expanding all of the subdirectory branches of the `src/main/java` directory structure.
. Inspect the Java source files.
+
****
*Question:* Which Java source file implements the Spring-based `reportService` and which Java source file handles the damage report generation?
****
+
. Locate the `syndesis-extension-definition.json` extension definition file and double-click it.
* It resides in the `../resources/META-INF/syndesis` subdirectory.
. Analyze the contents of the extension definition file, and visualize the use of this extension:
+
image::images/extension-definition.png[]

. Expand the *Outline* view and inspect the structure of the extension definition:
+
image::images/outline-extension-definition.png[]
+
****
*Questions:*

* Looking at the extension definition, what configurable aspects of the technical extension can you identify?
* If you had a new requirement for a complex data structure or shape as an input, how would you design the technical extension?
****
+
. In the *Project Explorer* view, navigate to the `../resources/camel` subdirectory in the `damage-reporter` project.
. Locate the `extension.xml` file, which contains the Apache Camel route definition:
+
image::images/extension-camel-route.png[]
+
[NOTE]
In Fuse Ignite, every technical extension consists of implementation code as well as a technical extension definition file. The definition file defines the action that the extension performs, the type of implementation (either Camel endpoint or bean), the input data type, and the output data type. By changing the data types, different types of data (shapeless or shaped) can be handled using custom technical extensions.

. Analyze the `damage-report` Camel route, using both the *Source* and *Design* tabs of the Camel Editor plug-in.
+
****
*Questions:*

* What other possible exceptional circumstances, apart from reporting damaged products, can this damage reporting application be used for?
* How would you redesign the Camel route to meet those use case requirements?
****

== Customize Damage Reporter Application

In this section, you customize the Spring-based damage reporter application to address a new business requirement from Coolstore management.

[NOTE]
Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/tooling_user_guide/igniteextension/[Tooling User Guide] to learn how a technical extension is developed. This guide points out the conventions that must be followed regarding the contents of a custom-developed technical extensionâ€™s JSON file.

[TIP]
For technical extensions that you develop based on an Apache Camel route instead of a bean, the entry point of the extension must correspond to a Camel endpoint on that route. In addition, you have to specify both the input data shape and the output data shape for a technical extension that transforms data types.

. Walk through the `damage-reporter` project's code in your Developer Studio workspace:
+
image::images/damage-reporter-jbds.png[]
+
****
*Question:*

* Can you map the interactions between the six Java classes, using either a whiteboard or your favorite UML modeling tool?
** Discuss and compare your findings with your instructor, a classmate, or a colleague. If there are differences, try to arrive at a consensus.
****

. Make the necessary code changes to include the following new contacts:
+
[options="header",cols="5,5,5"]
|======
|Name|Number|Company
|Andreas Chang|937 512 235|Westside Premium
|Bala Gopal|988 345 111|Finest Goods
|Sergio Lucini|862 223 402|Eastside Specialty Outlets
|======

. Save your changes.
. Compile the `damage-reporter` project:
.. In the *Project Explorer* view, right-click the project and select *Run As -> Run Configurations*:
+
image::images/run-as-run-configurations.png[]
+
.. In the *Run Configurations* window, type `clean install` in the *Goals* field.
.. Make sure that the *User settings* field has the correct path for your Apache Maven `settings.xml` file.
.. Click *Apply*, then click *Run*.
+
[NOTE]
This sequence of steps is equivalent to executing the `mvn clean install` command from the command line.
+
image::images/run-configurations.png[]

. From the *Console* view, validate that the compilation of the `damage-reporter` project is a success:
+
