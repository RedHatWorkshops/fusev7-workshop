== Import the Damage Reporter application into your JBDS workspace

You will import the `Damage Reporter` application into JBDS, for analysis and eventual compilation of the code.

. Download the repository containing the lab assets to your preferred working directory `$lab_dir`, using *git*:
+
----
$ cd $lab_dir
$ git clone https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/fuse-ipaas-labs
----
+
. From the JBDS menu bar, select *File -> Import -> Existing Maven Projects*.
. Using the wizard, navigate to the directory containing the `pom.xml` for the `damage-reporter` project. This directory will is `/$lab_dir/fuse_ipaas_labs/04_technical_extensions/damage_reporter`.
. After the project import process completes, you will notice a `damage-reporter` project from the *Project Explorer* view in JBDS.
+
[NOTE]
The `Damage Reporter` project is a Java application that utilizes an Apache Camel route. The project also
implements a Spring-managed component `reportService`, which generates a list of damaged items that will eventually be included (together with the vendor contact list) as part of the product damage report.
+
. In the *Project Explorer* view, navigate through the source code for `Damage Reporter`, by expanding all the subdirectory branches of the `src/main/java` directory structure.
. Inspect the Java source files.
+
*QUESTION:* Which Java source file implements the Spring-based `reportService` and which Java source file handles the damage report generation?
+
. Locate the extension definition file `syndesis-extension-definition.json` and double-click on it. It resides in the `../resources/META-INF/syndesis` subdirectory.
. Analyse the contents of the extension definition file, and visualize the use of this extension.
+
image::images/extension-definition.png[]
+
. Expand the *Outline* view and inspect the structure of the extension definition.
+
image::images/outline-extension-definition.png[]
+
*QUESTION:* From the extension definition, what are the various configurable aspects of the technical extension that you can identify? If you had a new requirement for a complex data structure or shape as an input, how will you design the technical extension?
+
. In the *Project Explorer* view, navigate to the `../resources/camel` subdirectory in the `Damage Reporter` project.
. Locate the `extension.xml` file, which contains the Apache Camel Route definition.
+
[NOTE]
In Fuse Ignite, every technical extension consists of implementation code as well as a technical extensions definition file. The definition file defines the action that the extension will perform, the type of implementation (either Camel Endpoint or Bean), the input data type and the output data type. By changing the data types, different types of data (shapeless or shaped) can be handled using custom technical extensions.
+
image::images/extension-camel-route.png[]
+
. Analyse the `damage-report` Camel Route, using both the *Source* and *Design* tabs of the Camel Editor plugin.

*QUESTION:* What other possible exceptional circumstances, apart from the damaged condition of products, can this damage reporting application cater for? How would you re-design the Camel Route to meet these use case requirements?


== Customize the Damage Reporter application

You will customize the Spring-based application `Damage Reporter` to address a new business requirement from `Coolstore` Management.

[NOTE]
Learn how a technical extension is developed with the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/tooling_user_guide/igniteextension/[JBoss Fuse Tooling Guide]. You will appreciate from this guide that certain conventions regarding a custom developed technical extensionâ€™s JSON file contents must be observed.

[TIP]
For technical extensions that you develop based on an Apache Camel route, and not a bean, the entry point of the extension must correspond to a Camel endpoint on that route. In addition, you have to specify both the input data shape and the output data shape, for a technical extension that transforms data types.

. Walkthrough the code of the `damage-reporter` project located in your JBDS workspace.
+
image::images/damage-reporter-jbds.png[]
+
* *QUESTION:* Can you map the interaction flows between the six Java classes, either using a whiteboard or your favorite UML modeling tool?
* Discuss and compare your findings with your instructor, your classmate or your colleague. If there are differences, try to arrive on a consensus.
. Make necessary code changes to include the following new contacts:
+
[.noredheader,cols="5,5,5",caption=""]
|======
|*Name*|*Number*|*Company*
|Andreas Chang|937 512 235|Westside Premium
|Bala Gopal|988 345 111|Finest Goods
|Sergio Lucini|862 223 402|Eastside Specialty Outlets
|======
+
. Once the changes are made, save them.
. Perform a compilation of the `damage-reporter` project:
.. From the *Project Explorer* view, right-click on the project.
.. From the list of options, select *Run As* -> *Run Configurations*
+
image::images/run-as-run-configurations.png[]
+
.. On the *Run Configurations* window, provide the following text in the *Goals* field: `clean install`
.. Ensure that the *User settings* field has the correct path for your Apache Maven `settings.xml` file.
.. Click the *Apply* button, followed by clicking the *Run* button.
+
[NOTE]
This sequence of instructions is the equivalent of executing the command `mvn clean install` at command-line.
+
image::images/run-configurations.png[]
+
. From the *Console* view, validate that the compilation of the `damage-reporter` project is a success.

----
https://todo-app-<guid>.fuse-ignite.openshift.opentlc.com
----
+
. Using the *To Do app*, click *Show JMS Form* to display a field for a XML message.
. Click *Send JMS Message* to send that message to the AMQ broker.
+
[NOTE]
Successful execution returns a task from the *To Do app client API*. The task identifies the ID of
the damaged item as well as the contact information for its vendor.
+
. Edit the *XML message* to specify two damaged items:
.. Click *Show JMS Form* to display the message input box again.
.. In the XML message, change the entry for the undamaged item to specify
damaged="true".
.. Click *Send JMS Message*. The *To Do app client API* returns a new task that contains IDs for
two damaged items and contact information for the two vendors.
. Edit the XML message to specify an unknown vendor:
.. Click *Show JMS Form*.
.. In the XML message, for an item that has damaged="true", change the name of the
vendor.
.. Click *Send JMS Message*. The *To Do app client API* returns a new task that indicates that
there is no contact information for the vendors of `Coolstore`.
