== Fuse Ignite Environment Setup Lab

NOTE: This course includes at least one lab per module. Each lab is hands-on and typically takes about an hour to complete. Completing the labs prepares you to correctly answer many of the final assessment questions.

.Goal
* Provision a Fuse Ignite lab environment

.Requirements
* Red Hat OPENTLC credentials
* Either a Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome web browser installed on your PC
* Broadband Internet connection

.Lab Conventions
The following environment variable is used in this lab to reference an installation directory:

* `${lab_code}` refers to the lab assets directory, which contains a `pom.xml` file
** Its directory path contains `../ipaas-<version_number>/code`


.Remote Environment

This course provides an OpenShift Container Platform environment in the cloud. This environment is provisioned with the following:

* Fuse Ignite (release tag *fuse-ignite-1.3*)
* A _product catalog_ service that exposes a RESTful API with Swagger documentation
** This product catalog service supports several labs in this course.

Red Hat strongly recommends that you use this remote OpenShift Container Platform environment for the remainder of the labs in this course.

== Connect

=== Log In to OpenShift Container Platform Web Console

. Open a web browser on your host machine and navigate to the URL listed in your lab confirmation email.
.. Click through the warnings from your browser indicating that it has no knowledge of the Certificate Authority associated to your OpenShift Container Platform web console--it is secured using a self-signed certificate.

. Log in using your OPENTLC credentials:
+
image::images/ocp_login.png[]

. Once authenticated into the web console, navigate to the *My Projects* panel on the right.
* Expect to see a project whose name has the following convention: *fuse-ignite-$GUID* (where `$GUID` is the unique four-character identifier assigned to your project):
+
image::images/ocp_project.png[]
+
[TIP]
The URL for your Fuse Ignite application is structured like this: `https://fuse.fuse-ignite-<$GUID>.apps.<$Environment_ID>.openshift.opentlc.com`. One example of the URL to a particular Fuse Ignite application would be `https://fuse.fuse-ignite-3824.apps.ap2.openshift.opentlc.com/` where `3824` is the `$GUID` and `ap2` is the `$Environment_ID`.

. Click the project to open it.

=== Access Fuse Ignite Web Console

. From your *fuse-ignite* project in the web console, navigate to *Applications -> Routes*.
. Click the *syndesis* route:
+
image::images/ignite_route.png[]
. Accept the self-signed certificates used to secure the Fuse Ignite web console.
. Authenticate using your OPENTLC credentials.
* A web page launches, prompting you to authorize the Fuse Ignite application access to your OPENTLC account credentials.
. Select both check boxes and click *Allow selected permissions*:
+
image::images/authorize_access.png[]

. Review the *Home* page of the Fuse Ignite console, which displays the following system metrics:
* The number of integrations in use
* The number of connections available
* The total number of messages serviced by integrations
* The uptime for Fuse Ignite
+
. Click image:images/account_icon.png[] (*Account*) at the top right.
* Note the *Logout* option, which ends your session with the Fuse Ignite console and logs you out.
. Click image:images/help_icon.png[] (*Help*).
* Options for a tutorial, a user guide, and support information appear. Use these resources if you need help with Fuse Ignite.
. Click image:images/menu_icon.png[] (*Menu*) at the top left.
* Note that the left-hand panel containing options like *Integrations* and *Customizations* disappears.
. Click image:images/menu_icon.png[] *Menu* again to display the panel.
. Navigate through the other aspects of the left-hand panel on your own.
* Detailed explanations on the use of these features are provided in subsequent labs.

=== Access Coolstore Product Catalog Microservice

. Modify the URL of your Fuse Ignite console to construct the URL for the Coolstore product catalog microservice by replacing the first occurrence of `fuse.` (including the trailing period) in the URL  with `catalog-service-`.
+
[TIP]
====
The URL for your microservice is structured like this: `https://catalog-service-fuse-ignite-<$GUID>.apps.<$Environment_ID>.openshift.opentlc.com`.

.Sample URL
----
http://catalog-service-fuse-ignite-3824.apps.ap2.openshift.opentlc.com
----
====
. Open another web browser window on your host machine and navigate to the URL provided in the confirmation email from Red Hat OPENTLC.

* The JSON output from the microservice is displayed in the web browser window.
* You now have a working Fuse Ignite lab environment from which to conduct labs. In addition, you can use the microservice for your labs.
+
[NOTE]
====
There are two software applications hosted on the OPENTLC OpenShift Container Platform lab environment:

* Fuse Ignite for integration tooling
* Coolstore product catalog microservice for specific integration lab use
====

== Register Cloud Services Accounts

The course involves the use of cloud services, so you need to register accounts for the following cloud services before continuing with the remaining labs in this course.

. link:https://aws.amazon.com/free/start-your-free-trial/[Register] for a trial Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.
. link:https://developer.salesforce.com/signup/[Register] for a Salesforce Developer Edition account.
. link:https://help.twitter.com/en/create-twitter-account[Register] for a Twitter account.
