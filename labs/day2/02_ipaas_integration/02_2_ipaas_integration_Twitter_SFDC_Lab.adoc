+
image::images/add_to_integration.png[]

*Optional activity:* provide configuration information to both the Twitter and Salesforce connections. What will be the suitable configuration changes that comes to mind?

=== Add Steps to the Integration

Part of every integration are steps. A step operates on data obtained, from either a connection or a step, and makes it available to either the next connection or step.

Different types of steps are available, including a basic filter step and a data mapping step.
A _basic filter_ step checks tweets that mention specific keywords. The integration continues only if that content is present.
A data mapping step that correlates data captured from Twitter feeds with contact fields in Salesforce.

==== Add a Basic Filter step

. On the *Add to Integration* page, click the *Add a Step* button.
. Add a _basic filter_ step, by selecting *Basic Filter*.
+
image::images/add_a_step_basic_filter.png[]
+
. Enter *text* in the first field. Click on *text* which appears within the drop-down list for this field.
+
NOTE: By selecting *text*, the body of the tweet serves as the content to be filtered.
+
image::images/configure_rule_filter_text.png[]
+
. In the adjacent drop-down list, select *contains*. This will be the filter condition that has to be met in the integration.
. Type *#FuseIgniteRocks* into the empty *Keywords..* field. A valid tweet will have to contain the text in this field.
. Click *Done*. The _basic filter_ step has been created.
+
image::images/configure_basic_filter_step.png[]

==== Add a Data Mapper step

A _data mapper_ step that correlates Twitter mention fields to Salesforce contact fields is created next.

. In the left-hand pane of Fuse Ignite, move your arrow icon over the plus sign *'+'* located between the _basic filter step_ and the _finish connection_ (ie: Salesforce connection).
+
image::images/add_filter_step.png[]
+
. Click *Add a Step* on the pop-up display which appears.
+
image::images/add_a_step_data_mapper.png[]
+
. Click *Data Mapper*. Observe the data fields displayed in two columns, *Sources* and *Target* on the Fuse Ignite console.
. Create a mapping - starting from the *name* field in the *Sources* column and ending with both the *FirstName* and *LastName* fields in the *Target* column.
+
[NOTE]
The Twitter *name* field has to be mapped to two distinct fields in Salesforce: *FirstName* and *LastName* respectively.
+
[TIP]
If you made a mistake in creating a data mapping, it is easy to delete it. Simply click the garbage bin icon at the top of the *Mapping Details* pane, as shown below:
+
image::images/mapping_details_garbagebin.png[]
+
. In the *Sources* column, scroll down to the *user* field and expand it.
. Click the *name* field, located further down the list of fields.
. Click the downward-facing caret *V*.
. In the *Mapping Details* tab (located to the right of the console), under *Action*, select *Separate*.
. Within the *Targets* section, replace the value of the field `[None]` with the text *FirstName*.
. Select *FirstName* from the drop-down list that appears below the field.
+
image::images/configure_mapper_username_firstname.png[]
+
. Click *Add Target*, on the lower right of the screen.
. Within the second *Targets* section, replace the value of the field `[None]` with the text *LastName*.
. When *LastName* appears within a drop-down list below this field, select it.
+
NOTE: Notice that the _data mapper_ step displays a line from the Twitter *name* field to the Salesforce *FirstName* field, as well as a line from the Twitter *name* field to the Salesforce *LastName* field. Line of current focus is indicated in blue.
+
image::images/configure_mapper_username_firstname_lastname.png[]


==== Create a mapping from the Twitter *screenName* field to the Salesforce *Title* field

. In the *Sources* column, scroll down the list of fields and click on the *screenName* field.
. In the *Target* column, click the magnifying glass. Within the search field, enter the text *Title*.
. Select the *Title* field which appears in the *Target* column.
+
NOTE: Like before, the _data mapper_ step displays a line from the Twitter *screenName* field to the Salesforce *Title* field.


==== Create a mapping from the Twitter *text* field to the Salesforce *Description* field

. In the *Sources* column, click the magnifying glass. In the search field located on the same column, enter the string *text*.
+
image::images/source_column_text_field.png[]
+
. With the *user* tab structure expanded, select the field *text* in the *Sources* column.
+
image::images/configure_mapper_userscreenname_title.png[]

=== Complete the Integration setup

Now that you have completed the Integration, deploy and test it.

. Enter the name of the Integration _Twitter to Salesforce_ within the *Integration Name* field, on the left-hand pane.
. Click *Publish*. Deployment of the integration begins immediately and lasts several minutes.
. Select *Integrations* tab.
. Enter the name of the integration _Twitter to Salesforce_ in the left-hand pane, and validate that the integration is active.
+
image::images/twitter_to_salesforce_integration.png[]
+
. In addition, validate that the integration creates a Salesforce record only when you send a tweet that contains the specific keyword criteria defined in the _basic filter_ step.
. Proceed with a negative test case, by sending a Twitter tweet which:
.. Contains your Twitter handle with a `@` prefix
.. Does not contain the keywords specified in the _basic filter_ step. For instance:
+
----
@Hong loves #FuseIgnite.
----
+
. After a minute, validate that your Twitter handle (less the `@` prefix) does not exist in any Salesforce contact record.
. Proceed with a positive test case, by sending a Twitter tweet which:
.. Contains your Twitter handle with a `@` prefix
.. Contains the keywords specified in the _basic filter_ step. For instance:
+
----
@Hong believes #FuseIgniteRocks.
----
+
. After a few minutes, validate that a contact record containing your Twitter handle (without the `@` prefix) has been created in Salesforce.
+
image::images/salesforce_lead_summary.png[]
+
. *Question:* What are the fields in the Salesforce contact record that capture the information from your earlier tweet? Can you recognise the various parts of the text from the tweet?
+
[NOTE]
Verify that the text from your tweet is captured in the *Description* field, while your Twitter handle is captured in the *Title* field.
+
. [Optional] Recreate your integration, this time use the *Search criteria* functionality of *Twitter Connect* and the criteria for tweets to be captured as leads should be the phrase `#FuseIgniteRocks`.
+
*Question:* What are the rest of the changes that you have to make in order to complete this integration?

== Integration clean-up

+
image::images/integration_summary_stop.png[]
+
. Select the inactive integration _Twitter to Salesforce_.
. Click *Delete Integration*, followed by clicking *OK*, at the bottom of the summary pane.
+
[TIP]
Practice good housekeeping: delete integrations that are no longer needed. This will release resources used by the deleted integrations, back to the Fuse Ignite system resource pool.

You have completed, tests and cleaned up your first integration in Fuse Ignite.
