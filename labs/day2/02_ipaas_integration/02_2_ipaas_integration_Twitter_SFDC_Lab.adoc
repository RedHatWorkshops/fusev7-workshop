In this section, you create an integration that monitors Twitter feeds for any mention of your Twitter account name. An identified mention triggers the first step in the integration, which creates new Salesforce records with the Twitter feed information.

image::images/fuseignite_connections.png[]

=== Add Connections to Integration

. In the left-hand panel of the Fuse Ignite console, click *Integrations*.
* The available connections, including the ones for Salesforce and Twitter that you just created, are displayed.
. Click *Create Integration*.
* The *Choose a Start Connection* screen appears:
+
image::images/choose_start_connection.png[]
+
[NOTE]
====
The credentials defined for each connection are used when the integration is active. Both connections--Twitter and Salesforce--in this integration invoke the credentials that have been set in order to access the respective Twitter and Salesforce applications.
====

+
image::images/choose_finish_connection.png[]

. Select the Salesforce connection.
. On the *Choose an Action* screen, select *New record*:
+
image::images/choose_an_action_salesforce_new_record.png[]
+
NOTE: Data operations (CRUDL) are typical actions. For the Salesforce connection, the action you have to define involves creating new Salesforce records based on suitable leads captured from Twitter feeds.

. Select *Contact* as the Salesforce record to create.
. Click *Done*.
* The *Add to Integration* screen is displayed:
+
image::images/add_to_integration.png[]

. (Optional) Provide configuration information to both the Twitter and Salesforce connections.
+
****
*Question:* What are the suitable configuration changes that come to mind?
****

=== Add Steps to Integration

Part of every integration are steps. A step operates on data obtained, from either a connection or another step, and makes it available to either the next connection or step.

Different types of steps are available, including a _basic filter_ step and a _data mapping_ step.
The basic filter step checks tweets that mention specific keywords. The integration continues only if that content is present. The data mapping step correlates data captured from Twitter feeds with contact fields in Salesforce.

==== Add Basic Filter Step

. On the *Add to Integration* screen, click *Add a Step*.
. Select *Basic Filter*:
+
image::images/add_a_step_basic_filter.png[]

. Start typing `text` in the first field, then select *text* when it appears in the list:
+
image::images/configure_rule_filter_text.png[]
+
NOTE: By selecting *text*, the body of the tweet serves as the content to be filtered.

. In the adjacent list, select *contains*.
* This is the filter condition that has to be met in the integration.
. Type `#FuseIgniteRocks` in the *Keywords* field.
* A valid tweet has to contain the text in this field.
. Click *Done* to create the basic filter step:
+
image::images/configure_basic_filter_step.png[]


==== Add Data Mapper Step

In this section, you create a data mapper step that correlates Twitter mention fields to Salesforce contact fields.

. In the left-hand panel of Fuse Ignite, hover over the image:images/add_filter_icon.png[] icon located between the basic filter step and the finish connection and select *Add a step*:
+
image::images/add_filter_step.png[]
. On the *Choose a Step* screen, select *Data Mapper*:
+
image::images/add_a_step_data_mapper.png[]
+
. Create a mapping between the Twitter *name* field in the *Sources* panel and the Salesforce *FirstName* and *LastName* fields in the *Target* panel.
* You need to map to both, as Salesforce uses two fields for the name.
+
[TIP]
====
If you make a mistake while creating a data mapping, it is easy to delete it. Simply click the garbage bin icon at the top of the *Mapping Details* panel:

image::images/mapping_details_garbagebin.png[]
====

.. In the *Sources* panel, scroll down to the *user* folder and expand it.
.. Scroll down and click the *name* field.
.. In the *Action* section of the *Mapping Details* panel on the right, select *Separate* from the *Action* list.
.. In the *Targets* section, start typing `FirstName` in the field, then select *FirstName* from the list that appears.
+
image::images/configure_mapper_username_firstname.png[]
+
.. Click *Add Target*.
.. In the second *Targets* section, start typing `LastName`, then select *LastName* from the list.
** Observe that the data mapper step now displays a line from the Twitter *name* field to both the Salesforce *FirstName* field and *LastName* field (The blue lines highlight the current focus.):
+
image::images/configure_mapper_username_firstname_lastname.png[]


==== Create Second Mapping

In this section, you create a mapping from the Twitter *screenName* field to the Salesforce *Title* field.

. In the *Sources* panel, scroll down the list of fields and click *screenName*.
. In the *Target* panel, click image:images/magnifying_glass_icon.png[] and type `title` in the search field.
. Select the *Title* field when it appears.
* The data mapper step now displays a line from the Twitter *screenName* field to the Salesforce *Title* field:
+
image::images/configure_mapper_userscreenname_title.png[]

==== Create Third Mapping

In this section, you create a mapping from the Twitter *text* field to the Salesforce *Description* field.

. In the *Sources* panel, click image:images/magnifying_glass_icon.png[] and type `text` in the search field.

. Expand the *user* folder and select the *text* field:
+
image::images/source_column_text_field.png[]

. In the *Target* panel, click image:images/magnifying_glass_icon.png[] and type `Description` in the search field, then click the *Description* field when it appears:
+
image::images/configure_mapper_statustext_description.png[]
+
. Click image:images/grid_icon.png[] above the *Mapping Details* panel.

. Click *Publish*.
* Deployment of the integration begins immediately and lasts several minutes.
. Click *Integrations*.
. Select the *Twitter to Salesforce* integration and verify that it is active:
+
image::images/twitter_to_salesforce_integration.png[]

==== Validate Integration

In this section, you test that the integration creates a Salesforce record only when you send a tweet that contains the specific keyword criteria defined in the basic filter step.

. Start with a negative test case by sending a tweet that meets the following criteria:
* Contains your Twitter handle with the `@` prefix
* Does not contain the keywords specified in the basic filter step
+
.Sample Tweet
----
@Hong loves #FuseIgnite.
----
. After a minute, confirm that your Twitter handle (without the `@` prefix) does not exist in any Salesforce contact record.
. Next, try a positive test case by sending a tweet that meets the following criteria:
* Contains your Twitter handle with a `@` prefix
* Contains the keywords specified in the basic filter step
+
.Sample Tweet
----
@Hong believes #FuseIgniteRocks.
----
+
. After a few minutes, confirm that a contact record containing your Twitter handle (without the `@` prefix) was created in Salesforce:
+
image::images/salesforce_lead_summary.png[]
+
****
*Questions:*

* What are the fields in the Salesforce contact record that capture the information from your tweet?
* Can you recognize the various parts of the text from the tweet?
****
+
TIP: Verify that the text from your tweet is captured in the *Description* field and your Twitter handle is captured in the *Title* field.

. (Optional) Recreate the integration, this time using the *Search criteria* functionality of *Twitter Connect* and the phrase `#FuseIgniteRocks` as the criteria for tweets to be captured as leads.
+
****
*Question:* What are the other changes that you have to make in order to complete this integration?
****

== Clean Up Integration

. In the left-hand panel of the Fuse Ignite console, click *Integrations*.
. Select the *Twitter to Salesforce* integration:
+
image::images/integrations_twitter_salesforce.png[]

. Click *Stop Integration*:
+
image::images/integration_summary_stop.png[]
. Click *OK* at the bottom of the summary panel.
* This deactivates the integration.

. Select the inactive *Twitter to Salesforce* integration.
. Click *Delete Integration*, then click *OK* at the bottom of the summary panel.
+
[TIP]
Practice good housekeeping: Delete integrations that are no longer needed. This releases the resources used by the integrations back to the Fuse Ignite system resource pool.

You have completed, tested, and cleaned up your integration in Fuse Ignite.
