== Microservice to Flat File Integration Lab

NOTE: This lab takes about an hour to complete. It covers topics you need to know to correctly complete the final assessment.

.Goals
* Design an integration for a cloud-based data persistence solution, where JSON data from a microservice is synchronized and persisted to a flat file on a remote server.
* Implement the planned integration using Fuse Ignite

.Prerequisite
* A provisioned Fuse Ignite environment

.Overview
In this lab, you fulfill the requirements for a cloud-based data synchronization solution by integrating a provider of JSON data, namely a microservice, with a remote file hosting server designated to host the destination copy of the data.
The data is hosted by Coolstore, an online business that operates as a wholesaler of quality consumer products. The consumer of the data is any reseller of Coolstore products.

The data is to be persisted into a flat file, which is created upon the initial synchronization with the microservice using a Fuse Ignite integration. This integration scenario is real-time and remains active indefinitely unless you stop it.

As the integration actively polls the microservice for product catalog data from the Coolstore e-commerce business, the flat file is constantly refreshed with the most current data that the microservice offers. This assurance of data quality makes resellers of Coolstore products confident that they can download correct data from the remote file hosting server at any time. Resellers of Coolstore products utilize this product catalog data as part of their business operations.

. At the top left corner of the Fuse Ignite console, in the *Enter integration name...* field, type
`Microservice to File`.
. At the top right corner of the console, click *Publish*.
. While the integration is being deployed, click the *Done* button.
* A green check mark appears to the right of the *Microservice to File* integration when the integration is successfully deployed.


== Test Microservice to File Integration

In this section, you test the integration.

=== Interpret JSON Output from Microservice

. In the left-hand panel of the Fuse Ignite console, click *Integrations*.
. Select the *Microservice to File* integration.
. Validate that the *Microservice to File* integration is active.
. In a separate web browser window, access the Coolstore product catalog microservice using the URL identified earlier from the confirmation email.
. Test the `/products` API operation.
. Note the response in JSON format, displayed in the web browser window.
+
****
*Question:* Can you identify the individual products listed, as well as their attributes?
****

=== Validate Data Quality

. Using an FTP client, or a web-based console if available, log in and navigate to the root directory of your web hosting service account.
. Navigate to the `./htdocs` subdirectory.
. Locate and download the `product-catalog.txt` file to your local PC.
. Locate the `product-catalog.txt` file on your local PC and open it using your favorite text editor.
. Compare the contents of the `product-catalog.txt` file with the response from the test of the `/products` API operation of the Coolstore product catalog microservice using the Swagger user interface of the microservice.
+
****
*Questions:*

* Do the contents of the flat file differ from the JSON-based response from the earlier API operation test?
* What are your conclusions regarding the function of the Microservice to File integration?
****

. On the *Integration Summary* screen of the Fuse Ignite console, explore both the *Activity* and *Metrics* tabs:
+
image::images/integration-summary-metrics.png[]
* Additional step activity are logged and made available through the *Activity* tab, while the uptime, total number of messages, and errors are listed on the *Metrics* tab.

=== Test Data Transfer

. Using the FTP client, or a web-based console if available, delete the `product-catalog.txt` files from the remote web host and the local PC.
. After a minute or so, list the contents of the `./htdocs` subdirectory.
. Verify that the `product-catalog.txt` file appears again.
+
****
*Question:* If the Microservice to File integration is not active, will this file appear?
****
. Locate and download the `product-catalog.txt` file to your local PC.
. Locate the `product-catalog.txt` file on your local PC and open it using your favorite text editor.
. Compare the contents of the `product-catalog.txt` file with the JSON-based response from the Coolstore product catalog microservice, which is displayed in the web browser window.
+
****
*Question:* Does this validate that the Microservice to File integration achieves its objective of real-time data synchronization for the benefit of resellers of Coolstore products?
****

== Design Integrations to Enable Microservice Operations (Optional)

In this section, you implement the rest of the API operations of the Coolstore product catalog microservice. It is likely that other connectors (apart from HTTP and FTP) have to be used for this lab exercise, so you are encouraged to complete other labs before attempting this lab exercise.

. Access the Swagger user interface of the Coolstore product catalog microservice, using the URL provided in the confirmation email.
. Test the various API operations of the microservice through the use of the Swagger user interface, taking note of the parameters and responses.
. Provide an architecture design, with description, of each new Fuse Ignite integration that supports a distinct API operation of the Coolstore product catalog microservice.
* Every integration must map to a distinct endpoint of the Coolstore product catalog microservice, thereby enabling a business operation--for example, the Microservice to File integration performs a retrieval of the current product catalog.
+
****
*Questions:*

* Should all API operations of this microservice be implemented using Fuse Ignite integrations, or is there a better alternative for some API operations?
* Does this hybrid integration approach suit any business use case that you have encountered?
****

== Monitor Camel Route Within Integration

In this section, you analyze the statistics of the Camel route that the Microservice to File integration is built on.

As the underlying technology for Fuse Ignite integration are Apache Camel routes, it is useful to access the Hawtio console, embedded in every integration, in order to monitor the Camel routes and inflight exchange messages.

. From the OpenShift Container Platform web console, select *Overview* from the left-hand panel.
. Click the pod icon next to the Microservice to File deployment:
+
image::images/pod-integration.png[]
+
[NOTE]
====
Each Fuse Ignite integration is containerized in its own OpenShift pod.
Having access to the pod logs for each integration helps in diagnosing the status and issues regarding the use of the integration.
====
+
. Click the *Open Java Console* link:
+
image::images/open-java-console.png[]
* This launches the Hawtio console that monitors the activity and performance statistics of the Apache Camel route that forms the structure of the integration.

. Explore the console and take note of the various statistics for the Camel route that belongs to the Microservice to File integration.
. Select the *Attributes* tab on the Hawtio console:
+
image::images/attributes-java-console.png[]
* Note the number of inflight exchanges, delta processing time, last processing time, and minimum processing times.
. Select the *Trace* tab and then click *Start tracing* to activate tracing on the screen displayed:
+
image::images/trace-java-console.png[]

. Observe the trace statistics and the inflight exchange activity.
+
****
*Question:* Are you able to explain these statistics meaningfully to a business stakeholder who needs to understand the performance of the solution?
****

== Import and Export Integration

In this section, you back up your integration and then import and retest it.
