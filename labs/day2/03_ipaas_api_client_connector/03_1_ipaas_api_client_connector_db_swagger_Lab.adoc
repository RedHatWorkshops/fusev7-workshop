= API Client Connector Lab - Database to RESTful Service Scenario

This course includes at least one lab per module. Each lab is hands-on and typically takes about an hour to complete. Executing the course labs prepares you to correctly answer many of the final assessment questions.

.Goals
* Create an API Client Connector to an external REST service, using a swagger document
* Create an Integration using this new API Client Connection and the PostgresDB Connector, using Red Hat Fuse Ignite
* Use a Data Mapper step to map fields between the schema of PostgresDB and the schema of the external REST service

CoolWater Inc. is a local water utility company. CoolWater Inc. requires you to implement a payment management system that extends an online service to their clients, for convenience of water bill payment.
The design of the integration will involve capturing of input from a web application (called To Do App) in a PostgresDB database, which will then initiate a API REST connection to a web service that displays the payment information on the customer billing portal of CoolWater Inc.
Implement this client use case that supports recurring billing for clients of CoolWater Inc.

+
image::images/01-Step-37.png[]
+
[NOTE]
Note that the results expire every three hour interval.


== Create an API Client Connector

Next, create an API Client Connector using an existing Swagger document.

[NOTE]
A link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/[Swagger] document is a JSON object, developed with the link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md[OpenAPI] specification in mind.
It serves as both an standard-based interface, as well as documentation, for a RESTful service. With the Swagger interface, minimal  implementation logic needs to be generated, in order to connect to RESTful services. This ease of use has led to the rapid adoption of the Swagger in application development projects.

. On the Red Hat Fuse Ignite console, click on the *Customizations* link on the left-hand pane.
+
image::images/01-Step-04.png[]
