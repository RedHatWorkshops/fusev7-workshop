== Database to RESTful Service Connector Lab

NOTE: This lab takes about an hour to complete. It covers topics you need to know to correctly complete the final assessment.

.Goals
* Create an API client connector to an external REST service, using a Swagger document
* Create an integration using this new API client connector and the PostgresDB connector, using Fuse Ignite
* Use a data mapper step to map fields between the PostgresDB schema and the external REST service schema

.Overview
CoolWater Inc. is a local water utility company that requires you to implement a payment management system that provides their clients with a convenient online water bill payment interface. The design of the integration involves capturing input from the To Do web application in a PostgreSQL database, which then initiates a REST API connection to a web service that displays the water bill payment details on the customer billing portal of CoolWater Inc. In this lab, you implement this client use case that supports recurring billing for clients of CoolWater Inc.

+
image::images/01-Step-37.png[]
+
[NOTE]
Note that the results expire every three hours.


== Create API Client Connector

Next, you create an API client connector using an existing Swagger document.

[NOTE]
A link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/[Swagger] document is a JSON object, developed with the link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md[OpenAPI Specification] in mind.
It serves as both a standards-based interface, as well as documentation, for a RESTful service. With the Swagger interface, minimal implementation logic needs to be generated in order to connect to RESTful services. This ease of use has led to the rapid adoption of Swagger in application development projects.

. In the left-hand panel of the Fuse Ignite console, select *Customizations*:
+
image::images/01-Step-04.png[]

. On the *API Client Connectors* screen, click *Create API Connector*.
* The *Upload Swagger Specification* screen appears. You have the option to either upload a Swagger document through a file upload facility, or to access a hosted Swagger document.
+
. Select the *Use a URL* radio button.
. Enter the location of the Swagger document for the customer billing portal REST service: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weimeilin79/fuse7tp3demo/master/waterpayment.yml`.
+
image::images/01-Step-05.png[]
. Click *Next*.
* The *Review Actions* screen appears:
+
image::images/01-Step-06.png[]
+
****
*Question:* Can you recognize the various actions that are available on the customer billing portal and the number of operations that are imported? 

* *Hint* You use these operations while using the API client connector as part of an active integration, and understanding their objectives is important for your integration project.
****
+
. Click *Next*.
* The *Specify Security* screen appears:
+
image::images/01-Step-07.png[]

. Click *Next*.
* The *Review/Edit Connector Details* screen appears:
+
image::images/01-Step-08.png[]
+
. Review and take note of the the data on the screen.
. Click *Create API Connector*.
* The new *Pay Water Bill* connector appears as an entry on the *API Client Connectors* screen:
+
image::images/01-Step-09.png[]

* Note the description of the connector, as well as the frequency of use by Fuse Ignite integrations.
. Select the *Pay Water Bill* connector.
* The details of the connector appear, including the imported operations, host, base URL, and description.
+
****
*Question:* Using a web browser to view the Swagger document for the customer billing portal, can you identify similar details regarding the *Pay Water Bill* connector that you just set up?
****

You have now created an API client connector to a RESTful service, using a Swagger document.


== Create Connection

In this section, you create a connection using the *Pay Water Bill* API client connector. This provides access to the customer billing portal's hosted RESTful service.

. In the left-hand panel of the Fuse Ignite console, select *Connections*:
