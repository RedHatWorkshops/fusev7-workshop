== AMQ to RESTful Service Connector Lab

NOTE: This lab takes about an hour to complete. It covers topics you need to know to correctly complete the final assessment.

.Prerequisite
* Completion of _Database to RESTful Service Connector Lab_

.Goals
* Create an integration using the existing API client connector to an external REST service and an AMQ connector, using Fuse Ignite
* Use a data mapper step to map fields between the AMQ message schema and the external REST service schema

CoolWater Inc. is a local water utility company. The payment management system that you implemented for CoolWater provides their clients with a convenient online water bill payment interface. This online service is accessed via a REST API connection to a web service that displays the water bill payment details on Coolwater's link:https://water-company-tp3demo.4b63.pro-ap-southeast-2.openshiftapps.com/main[customer billing portal]. The portal conducts a data cleanup every three hours.

You are tasked with implementing an event-triggered recurring payment solution that must utilize Coolwater's existing IT infrastructure. This simulates recurring payments that are scheduled on a monthly basis, and an event triggers a single payment once the payment date arrives.

Status of the recurring payments can be viewed from the link:https://water-company-tp3demo.4b63.pro-ap-southeast-2.openshiftapps.com/main[customer billing portal].
