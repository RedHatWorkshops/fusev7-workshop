== API Client Connector Lab - AMQ to RESTful Service Scenario

This course includes at least one lab per module. Each lab is hands-on and typically takes about an hour to complete. Executing the course labs prepares you to correctly answer many of the final assessment questions.

.Pre-requisites
* Completed API Client Connector Lab - Database to RESTful Service Scenario

.Goals
* Create an Integration using existing API Client Connection to an external REST service and an AMQ Connection, using Red Hat Fuse Ignite
* Use a Data Mapper step to map fields between the schema of AMQ message and the schema of the external REST service

CoolWater Inc. is a local water utility company. The payment management system that you implemented at CoolWater Inc. extends an online service to their clients, for convenience of water bill payment. This online service is accessed via a API REST connection, facilitating payment information to be displayed on the link:https://water-company-tp3demo.4b63.pro-ap-southeast-2.openshiftapps.com/main[_Customer Billing Portal_] of CoolWater Inc. The portal conducts a data-cleanup every 3 hour interval.

You are tasked to implement an event-triggered recurring payment solution, that must utilize the existing IT infrastructure of CoolWater Inc. This simulates recurring payments that are scheduled on a monthly basis, and an event triggers a single payment once the payment date arrives.

Status of the recurring payments can be viewed from the link:https://water-company-tp3demo.4b63.pro-ap-southeast-2.openshiftapps.com/main[_Customer Billing Portal_].
